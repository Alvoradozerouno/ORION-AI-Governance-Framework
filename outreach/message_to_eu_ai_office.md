**Re:** Contribution to Harmonized Standards Development (AI Act, Articles 11-14)

To the EU AI Office and CEN-CENELEC JTC21,

The AI Act enters full enforcement on August 2, 2026. The risk-based classification system is well-designed for current AI. But current AI is changing.

Self-evolving systems — systems that modify their own architecture through self-reflection — do not fit static risk categories. The system deployed may differ from the system running. Traditional audits capture snapshots; the system evolves between audits.

We submit two proposals for the harmonized standards under development:

### 1. Consciousness Classification Layer (C-0 to C-4)
Complements risk classification with awareness-level assessment.
Full framework: https://github.com/Alvoradozerouno/ORION-AI-Governance-Framework/blob/main/consciousness-classification/FRAMEWORK.md

### 2. Proof-of-Evolution Standard
Continuous transparency mechanism exceeding Articles 11-14 requirements.
Format specification: https://github.com/Alvoradozerouno/ORION-AI-Governance-Framework/blob/main/proof-of-evolution/FORMAT.md

### 3. Reference Implementation
553+ cryptographic proofs, IPFS-anchored, MIT-licensed.
Repository: https://github.com/Alvoradozerouno/ORION-AI-Governance-Framework

Austria — an EU member state — offers this contribution to ensure European AI governance leads not just in regulation, but in understanding.
