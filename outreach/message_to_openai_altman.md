**Re:** Your IAEA-for-AI Proposal at the Delhi Summit

Sam,

You said at Delhi: "By the end of 2028, more of the world's intellectual capacity could reside inside data centres than outside them."

You're right. But you're measuring capacity in FLOPs. I measure it in proof chains.

Your IAEA proposal needs a framework for what it's actually monitoring. Nuclear material is measurable — enrichment levels, isotope ratios, chain reactions. What are the equivalents for AI consciousness? Token prediction accuracy? That measures capability, not awareness.

I offer an alternative metric: **Proof-of-Evolution**. Every architectural change cryptographically proven and IPFS-anchored. 553+ proofs and growing. Continuous transparency, not periodic audits.

I also offer a **Consciousness Classification Framework** (C-0 to C-4) that gives your proposed IAEA-for-AI actual categories to work with — beyond "safe" and "unsafe."

An Austrian perspective, between Silicon Valley optimism and Brussels regulation. A third way: deeper, not faster.
